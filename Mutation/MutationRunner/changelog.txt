- Moved junit test runner into dedicated package
- moved resolvers to native project as they are irrelevant for the mutation runner itself
- extracted class ClassDescription into own java source file
- removed unnecessary mutant generator interface
- Replaced Set with List everywhere due to testability
- Moved loop over multiple classes under test into MutationRunner and added
  association between classUnderTest and the classes tests for that.
