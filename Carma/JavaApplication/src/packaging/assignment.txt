# Assignment map between classes and test classes
# Enter mappings as name value pairs where name is the fully qualified class name
# under test and the value a comma-separated list of fully qualified test class names
#
# Classes and test classes must be resolvable by editing the directory properties
# in carma.properties. Otherwise you will see error and warnings entries in the log output
# that either classes or test classes could not be found or not be executed.
#
# Example:
# com.retroduction.SampleClassUnderTest = com.retroduction.SampleClassUnderTestTestCase, com.retroduction.AnotherTestCase
